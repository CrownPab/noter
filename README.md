# Noter: Under Development (Nothing is usable yet ðŸ˜¢)

Tired of trying and testing many notes taking app so decided to make my own...

Uses Tauri with Vite-React-Chakra frontend

Hopefully, writing this Readme will help me commit to this repo. _(If you don't see this repo after a while, that means I gave up!)_

## Setup

Make sure you have the following things installed: -

- git (to clone this project)
- rust
- nodejs
- pnpm

Then you just need to write `pnpm install` to install all the frontend dependencies.

After you are done with that, you can run the app using the following commands: -
- `pnpm dev` would run the app with frontend in browser
- `pnpm start` would run the app as a native application
